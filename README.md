# Dashboard

A simple *flask* app to provide a dashboard for my recent interests.

This includes a filterable `/finance` endpoint for tracking what I've spent
money on, a `/books` endpoint for my reading list (both *finished*, *unread*,
and possible purchases), and a WIP `/research` endpoint for the work both my
colleagues and myself are doing at UoS.
